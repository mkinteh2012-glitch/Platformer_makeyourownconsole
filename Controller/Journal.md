PCB 
So right now I just did  PCB took a while had to redo routing A LOT, like 8 or 9 times because i kinda forgot about vias  I kinda have not a lot of time so right now I'm basiclly done all i need to do is make a BOM and because I want an exposed PCB because I think the green would look nice i decided to do PCB first because i might not got schematic time to finish this up so imma back track to do schematic
